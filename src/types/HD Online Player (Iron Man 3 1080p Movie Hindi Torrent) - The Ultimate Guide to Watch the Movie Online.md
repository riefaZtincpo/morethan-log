The movie begins with a flashback to 1999, when Tony Stark met Maya Hansen (Rebecca Hall), a scientist who invented a revolutionary technology called Extremis, which can regenerate human cells and heal injuries. He also rejected Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce), a disabled scientist who wanted to work with him. In the present day, Tony is suffering from anxiety attacks and insomnia after his near-death experience in The Avengers. He spends his time tinkering with his Iron Man suits and neglecting his girlfriend Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), who is now the CEO of Stark Industries.
 
Meanwhile, a mysterious terrorist known as the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) claims responsibility for a series of bombings around the world, which leave no traces of explosives. One of the attacks injures Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau), Tony's former bodyguard and friend. Tony publicly challenges the Mandarin and gives him his home address, inviting him to a fight. The Mandarin responds by sending helicopters to attack Tony's mansion, which is destroyed along with most of his suits. Tony manages to escape in his prototype suit, the Mark 42, but it malfunctions and crashes in Tennessee. There, he meets a young boy named Harley (Ty Simpkins), who helps him repair his suit and investigate the local explosion.
 
Tony discovers that the bombings are caused by Extremis, which can make people explode if they are unstable. He also learns that Killian is behind the Mandarin, who is actually a British actor named Trevor Slattery hired by Killian to be a scapegoat. Killian has been using Extremis to create super-soldiers for his company Advanced Idea Mechanics (AIM), and has also kidnapped Pepper and injected her with Extremis. He plans to kill the President of the United States (William Sadler) and replace him with his puppet Vice President (Miguel Ferrer), who will help him cover up his crimes.
 
Tony teams up with his friend Colonel James Rhodes (Don Cheadle), who wears another suit of armor called the Iron Patriot. They infiltrate Killian's headquarters and rescue Pepper, who has gained superpowers from Extremis. They also free Slattery and the President, and fight against Killian and his henchmen. Tony summons all his remaining suits to help him in the battle, and gives one of them to Pepper. Together, they manage to defeat Killian and destroy all the Extremis soldiers.
 
In the aftermath, Tony decides to undergo surgery to remove the shrapnel from his chest and destroy his arc reactor, which powered his suits. He also destroys all his suits as a sign of his devotion to Pepper. He declares that he will always be Iron Man, even without his armor. He also helps Harley by giving him new equipment for his garage.
 
The movie ends with a post-credits scene, where it is revealed that Tony has been narrating his story to Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), aka the Hulk, who fell asleep during the story.
