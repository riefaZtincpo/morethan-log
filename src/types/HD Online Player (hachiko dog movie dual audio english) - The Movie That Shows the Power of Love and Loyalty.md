If you are wondering why Hachi is such a special dog, here are some facts about him and his breed:

- Hachi was an Akita, a large and powerful dog breed that originated in Japan. Akitas are known for their loyalty, courage, and intelligence. They are also very independent and can be stubborn at times.
- Hachi was based on a real dog named HachikÅ, who lived in Tokyo in the 1920s and 1930s. HachikÅ would accompany his master, Professor HidesaburÅ Ueno, to the Shibuya train station every morning and wait for him to return in the evening. One day, Ueno died of a cerebral hemorrhage while at work and never came back. HachikÅ continued to wait for him at the station for almost 10 years until his own death in 1935.
- HachikÅ became a national symbol of loyalty and devotion in Japan. His story was widely reported by the media and inspired many books, films, and statues. In 1934, a bronze statue of HachikÅ was erected at the Shibuya station, where he used to wait. The statue still stands today and is a popular meeting spot for people.

Hachi: A Dog's Tale is a tribute to HachikÅ and his remarkable bond with his master. The film is set in the United States and changes some details of the original story, but it captures the essence of HachikÅ's loyalty and love. If you are a dog lover or a fan of emotional dramas, you should definitely watch this film online in dual audio.
