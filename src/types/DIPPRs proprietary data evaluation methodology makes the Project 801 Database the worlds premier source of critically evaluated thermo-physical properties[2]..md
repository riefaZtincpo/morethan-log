DIPPR Project 801 is a database of evaluated thermophysical and transport properties for industrially important chemicals. It is sponsored by the Design Institute for Physical Property Research (DIPPR), which is a consortium of companies and academic institutions that aims to provide reliable data for chemical process and equipment design. DIPPR Project 801 contains data for 34 constant properties and 49 temperature-dependent properties for more than 2000 compounds, as well as molecular structure, hazard properties, and other information. The data are based on experimental measurements and, when necessary, estimated values that have been reviewed by experts to ensure the highest accuracy possible.
 
The full version of DIPPR Project 801 is available as a book[^1^] or as an online resource[^2^] that can be accessed through various platforms, such as Knovel, Aspen Properties, or Chemstations. The full version includes interactive tables that allow users to plot and calculate property values at different temperatures and pressures. The full version also provides coefficient sets for various equations of state and correlations that can be used to estimate properties for compounds that are not in the database.

DIPPR Project 801 is an invaluable tool for chemical engineers who need reliable and comprehensive data for designing, optimizing, and troubleshooting chemical processes and equipment. It can help engineers to select suitable chemicals for a given process, to predict phase equilibria and reaction kinetics, to design heat exchangers and reactors, to perform safety analysis and risk assessment, and to comply with environmental regulations. DIPPR Project 801 is widely used by industry and academia as a standard reference for physical property data.
  
DIPPR Project 801 is updated regularly to include new compounds and properties, as well as to revise existing data based on the latest literature and measurements. The project employs a rigorous methodology to evaluate data from various sources, such as journals, books, reports, patents, and databases. The methodology involves applying thermodynamic and physical constraints, checking for consistency and accuracy, performing regression analysis, and reviewing by experts. The project also provides detailed documentation of the data sources, evaluation process, and uncertainty estimates for each compound and property.
 
DIPPR Project 801 is a collaborative effort of more than 30 member companies and academic institutions that represent different sectors of the chemical industry, such as petrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, polymers, specialty chemicals, and engineering services. The members provide input on the selection of compounds and properties, as well as feedback on the data quality and usability. The members also have exclusive access to the most recent data for at least five years before they are released to the public. The project is sponsored by the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE), which is the world's leading organization for chemical engineering professionals.
 
DIPPR Project 801 welcomes contributions from researchers and practitioners who have reliable and relevant data for industrially important chemicals. The project also encourages suggestions for new compounds and properties that are of interest to the chemical engineering community. Contributors can submit their data through an online form or contact the project manager for more information. Contributors will be acknowledged in the database and may receive a complimentary copy of the full version of DIPPR Project 801.
