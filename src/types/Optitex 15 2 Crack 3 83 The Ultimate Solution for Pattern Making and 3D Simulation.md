Optitex 15.2.3 has many features and enhancements that make it a powerful and versatile software for fashion design. Some of the features are:

- Nesting - You can optimize the fabric usage and reduce waste by automatically nesting your pieces according to various parameters, such as material type, shading, shrinkage, spacing, etc. You can also run multiple nestings in a queue and save the results with the same name. You can edit the nesting queue while running and skip to the next marker after a certain idle time. You can also allocate fabric rolls according to shrinkage and shading data.
- Marker - You can create and edit markers with ease and accuracy. You can automatically alternate bundles, block fuse pieces with different angles, edit optimum rectangle groups, and calculate the total cut line while taking shared line into consideration. You can also export your markers in various formats, such as ASTM XML, which supports notch types, start point, cutting direction, holes, etc.
- 3D - You can create realistic 3D simulations of your designs and see how they fit and move on a virtual model. You can use various tools to adjust the fabric properties, stitch types, darts, pleats, etc. You can also view all the warnings and errors that occur during stitching and simulation in a new window called "Diagnostics". You can also split connection points and create internal curves on external pieces.

Optitex 15.2.3 is a comprehensive software that covers every aspect of fashion design, from pattern making to 3D visualization. It can help you save time and money, improve quality and creativity, and achieve your design goals.
