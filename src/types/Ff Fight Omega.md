One of the main features of Ff Fight Omega is the Omega System, which allows players to unleash powerful attacks and transformations based on their character's affinity. The Omega System has four elements: Fire, Ice, Lightning, and Darkness. Each character has a primary and a secondary element, which determines their strengths and weaknesses. For example, Cloud is Fire/Lightning, Sephiroth is Darkness/Fire, and Tifa is Ice/Lightning.
 
By filling up the Omega Gauge during battle, players can activate their Omega Mode, which enhances their speed, power, and defense. They can also use their Omega Skill, which is a unique move that varies depending on the character and the element. For example, Cloud's Omega Skill is Omnislash, Sephiroth's is Supernova, and Tifa's is Final Heaven. Some characters can also use their Omega Form, which is a transformation that changes their appearance and abilities. For example, Noctis can transform into his Armiger mode, Lightning can transform into her Knight of Etro mode, and Yuna can transform into her Songstress mode.
 
Ff Fight Omega also has a variety of stages and arenas that are inspired by the Final Fantasy games. Each stage has its own theme, music, and hazards that can affect the gameplay. For example, the Midgar stage has Shinra soldiers and helicopters that can attack the players, the Zanarkand stage has Sin's attacks that can damage the stage, and the Altissia stage has Leviathan's waves that can flood the arena. Some stages also have interactive elements that can be used to gain an advantage or escape from danger. For example, the Balamb Garden stage has a draw point that can restore health and magic, the Nibelheim stage has a reactor that can explode and cause a fire, and the Insomnia stage has a car that can be driven around.
