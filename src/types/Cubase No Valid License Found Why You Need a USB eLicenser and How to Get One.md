If you are trying to use Cubase and encounter the error message "No valid license found", you might be wondering what went wrong and how to fix it. This article will explain the possible causes and solutions for this error.
 
Cubase is a digital audio workstation (DAW) software that requires a license to run. There are two types of licenses for Cubase: USB-eLicenser and Soft-eLicenser. A USB-eLicenser is a physical device that stores the license and needs to be connected to your computer when using Cubase. A Soft-eLicenser is a virtual license container that is stored on your hard disk and does not require a USB device.

The type of license you need depends on the version of Cubase you have. Cubase Pro and Artist require a USB-eLicenser, while Cubase Elements, LE and AI can use either a USB-eLicenser or a Soft-eLicenser. You can check which type of license you have by opening the eLicenser Control Center (eLCC) software on your computer and looking at the left panel.
 
If you see a USB-eLicenser icon with your Cubase license on it, you need to make sure that your USB device is plugged in and recognized by your computer. If you don't see it, try unplugging and plugging it back in, or restarting your computer. If you still don't see it, your USB device might be broken or corrupted, and you need to contact Steinberg support for assistance.
 
If you see a Soft-eLicenser icon with your Cubase license on it, you don't need a USB device to use Cubase. However, if you see an empty Soft-eLicenser icon, or no icon at all, it means that your license is missing or not activated. To fix this, you need to use the activation code that you received when you purchased or registered Cubase. You can enter the activation code in the eLCC software by clicking on "Enter Activation Code" and following the instructions. This will download the license to your Soft-eLicenser and allow you to use Cubase.
 
If you don't have an activation code, or if you have already used it but still don't see your license, you might need to update your eLCC software to the latest version. You can download the latest version from [here](https://www.steinberg.net/en/company/technologies/elicenser.html). After installing the update, run the eLCC software as administrator and perform a maintenance task by clicking on "Perform Maintenance Tasks". This will check and repair your licenses and eLicensers.
