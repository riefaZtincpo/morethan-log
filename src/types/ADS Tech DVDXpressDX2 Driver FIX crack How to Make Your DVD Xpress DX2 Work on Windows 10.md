If you have an ADS Tech DVD Xpress DX2 device, you may have encountered a problem with its USB driver on Windows 10. This device is an analog video capture device that comes with Capwiz software, which allows you to transfer video from VHS tapes, camcorders, or other sources to your computer. However, some users have reported that Capwiz says USB driver not installed when they try to use the device on Windows 10.

This can be frustrating, especially if you have some precious videos that you want to digitize and preserve. Fortunately, there are some possible solutions that you can try to fix this issue and make your device work on Windows 10. Here are some steps that you can follow:
  
1. Check the device status in Device Manager. To do this, press Windows key + X and select Device Manager. Locate your DVD Xpress DX2 device and right-click to select Properties. Check for the device status under the General tab. If it shows a yellow exclamation mark or a code 28 error, it means that the driver is not installed or corrupted.
2. Run the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter. This is a built-in tool that can help you detect and fix common hardware problems on Windows 10. To run this tool, go to this link: [http://support.microsoft.com/mats/hardware\_device\_problems/en-us](http://support.microsoft.com/mats/hardware_device_problems/en-us) and click on Run now. Follow the on-screen instructions and see if it can resolve the issue.
3. Update the driver manually. If the troubleshooter does not help, you may need to update the driver manually from the manufacturer's website. However, since the original manufacturer's website (www.adstech.com) is no longer active, you may have to search for alternative sources online. One possible source is this link: [https://download.cnet.com/ADS-DVD-XPRESS-DX2/3000-2110\_4-161364.html](https://download.cnet.com/ADS-DVD-XPRESS-DX2/3000-2110_4-161364.html) where you can download the driver for free. However, be careful when downloading drivers from third-party websites, as they may contain malware or viruses. Make sure you scan the file with an antivirus program before installing it.
4. Install the driver in compatibility mode. If the driver does not work on Windows 10 even after updating it manually, you may need to install it in compatibility mode. This is a feature that allows you to run older programs or drivers on newer versions of Windows. To do this, right-click on the driver file and select Properties. Go to the Compatibility tab and check the box that says Run this program in compatibility mode for. Choose Windows XP Service Pack 3 from the drop-down menu and click OK. Then run the driver file as administrator and follow the installation wizard.

Hopefully, one of these methods will help you fix the ADS Tech DVD Xpress DX2 driver issue on Windows 10 and make your device work properly. If none of them work, you may have to contact Capwiz or Corel (the current owner of Movie Factory software that came with the device) for further assistance or look for another video capture device that is compatible with Windows 10.
