## Step 1: Choose a terrain set
 
World Works Games offers a wide range of terrain sets for different themes and scales, such as fantasy, sci-fi, horror, modern, historical, and more. You can browse their catalog on their website[^1^] and choose the terrain set that suits your game and preferences. Each terrain set has a detailed description, a preview image, and a price. Some terrain sets are also available as bundles that include multiple sets at a discounted price.
 
## Step 2: Purchase and download the terrain set
 
Once you have chosen a terrain set, you can add it to your cart and proceed to checkout. You will need to create an account or log in with your existing account to complete the purchase. You can pay with PayPal or credit card. After the payment is confirmed, you will receive an email with a link to download the terrain set. You can also access your downloads from your account page on the website.
 
The terrain set will be downloaded as a ZIP file that contains one or more PDF files. You will need to unzip the file using a program like WinZip or 7-Zip to access the PDF files. Each PDF file corresponds to a different component of the terrain set, such as walls, floors, roofs, props, etc. You can open the PDF files with a program like Adobe Reader or Foxit Reader.
 
## Step 3: Print the terrain set
 
Before you print the terrain set, you will need to prepare some materials and tools. You will need:
 
- Cardstock paper: This is a thick and sturdy paper that is suitable for printing terrain. You can find it at most office supply stores or online. The recommended weight is 110 lb (199 gsm) or higher.
- Color printer: You will need a color printer that can print on cardstock paper. You can use an inkjet or laser printer, but make sure it has enough ink or toner and that the print quality is high.
- Cutting tools: You will need a sharp hobby knife or scissors to cut out the printed terrain pieces. You will also need a cutting mat or board to protect your work surface.
- Glue: You will need glue to assemble the terrain pieces. You can use white glue, glue stick, hot glue gun, or double-sided tape, depending on your preference and the type of terrain.
- Ruler: You will need a ruler to measure and align the terrain pieces.
- Optional tools: Depending on the terrain set, you may also need some optional tools, such as scoring tools, hole punchers, foam core board, toothpicks, etc. The instructions for each terrain set will tell you what tools you need and how to use them.

To print the terrain set, you will need to follow these steps:

1. Open the PDF file of the terrain component you want to print.
2. Check the print settings and make sure they are correct. The most important settings are:
    - Paper size: Choose the paper size that matches your cardstock paper. Most World Works Games PDF files are designed for US Letter size (8.5 x 11 inches), but some may also have A4 size (210 x 297 mm) options.
    - Scale: Choose 100% or Actual Size to print the terrain at its intended scale. Do not choose Fit to Page or Shrink to Fit, as this will distort the size of the terrain.
    - Orientation: Choose Portrait or Landscape depending on the orientation of the PDF file.
    - Margins: Choose None or Minimum to avoid wasting paper and cutting off parts of the terrain.
3. Print the PDF file on cardstock paper. You may want to print a test page first to check if 8cf37b1e13
