Varnam is a type of musical composition in Carnatic music, the classical music tradition of South India. Varnam means "color" or "beauty" in Sanskrit, and it is a musical form that showcases the melodic and rhythmic aspects of a raga (a musical scale or mode).
 
Varnam can be classified into two categories: Abhyasa Ganam (practice music) and Sabha Ganam (performance music). Abhyasa Ganam varnams are meant for beginners and intermediate learners of Carnatic music, and they help them to master the basic elements of a raga, such as swaras (notes), gamakas (ornaments), and tala (rhythmic cycle). Sabha Ganam varnams are meant for advanced learners and performers of Carnatic music, and they help them to explore the nuances and variations of a raga, such as sancharas (phrases), prayogas (patterns), and alankaras (embellishments).

A typical varnam consists of two parts: Purvanga (first part) and Uttaranga (second part). The Purvanga consists of three sections: Pallavi (refrain), Anupallavi (second refrain), and Mukthayi Swara (first set of swara passages). The Uttaranga consists of two sections: Charanam (verse) and Charana Swara (second set of swara passages). The Pallavi and Anupallavi have lyrics that are usually in praise of a deity or a patron, while the Charanam has lyrics that are usually in praise of the composer or the raga. The Mukthayi Swara and Charana Swara have no lyrics, but only swaras that are sung in different speeds and patterns.
 
Varnams are composed in various ragas and talas, and they can be sung or played on various instruments, such as veena, violin, flute, etc. Varnams are usually sung at the beginning of a Carnatic music concert, as they help to warm up the voice and tune the ears to the raga. Varnams are also considered as miniatures of a raga, as they capture its essence and mood in a concise manner.

They also showcase the creativity and skill of the composers and performers who have contributed to this art form over centuries.
