Have you ever encountered a situation where you need to get the numerical data from a graph or plot, but you only have a scanned image or a PDF file? Maybe you want to reproduce a scientific result, analyze a historical trend, or compare different data sets. How can you get the (x,y) coordinates of the data points without manually measuring them?

One solution is to use a software tool called GetData Graph Digitizer 2.26. This is a program that allows you to digitize graphs and plots by tracing the lines or points on the image and converting them into numerical data. You can then export the data to a text file, a spreadsheet, or another application for further processing.
 
In this article, we will show you how to use GetData Graph Digitizer 2.26 to extract data from graphs and plots in four easy steps.
 
## Step 1: Open the image file
 
The first step is to open the image file that contains the graph or plot that you want to digitize. GetData Graph Digitizer 2.26 supports various image formats, such as TIFF, JPEG, BMP, and PCX. You can also open PDF files directly if you have Adobe Acrobat Reader installed on your computer.
 
To open an image file, click on the File menu and select Open Image. Alternatively, you can drag and drop the image file onto the main window of the program. You will see the image displayed on the screen, along with some tools and options on the right side.
 
## Step 2: Set the scale for the Cartesian system
 
The second step is to set the scale for the Cartesian system that corresponds to the graph or plot. This means that you need to define the origin (0,0) point and the units of the x-axis and y-axis. This will allow the program to convert the pixel coordinates of the image into real-world coordinates of the data.
 
To set the scale, click on the Axes menu and select Set Default Axes. You will see a dialog box where you can enter the coordinates of two points on each axis. You can either type in the values manually or click on the image to select them. You can also choose whether the axes are linear or logarithmic, and whether they are horizontal or vertical.
 
After setting the scale, you will see a grid overlay on top of the image, indicating the Cartesian system that you have defined.
 
## Step 3: Choose the digitization method
 
The third step is to choose the digitization method that suits your graph or plot. There are two main methods: manual and automatic.

The manual method allows you to trace the lines or points on the image by clicking on them with your mouse. You can adjust the color and thickness of the tracing line, as well as undo or erase any mistakes. You can also zoom in or out of the image for more accuracy.
 
The automatic method allows you to let the program detect and trace the lines or points on the image automatically. You can adjust some parameters, such as the color tolerance and edge detection threshold, to improve the accuracy of the detection. You can also edit or delete any unwanted traces after they are generated.
 
To choose a digitization method, click on one of the buttons on the toolbar: Manual Mode or Automatic Mode. You will see a dialog box where you can configure some settings for each method.
 
## Step 4: Export the resulting data
 
The final step is to export the resulting data that you have obtained from digitizing your graph or plot. You can export them as a text file, a spreadsheet file, or copy them to clipboard for pasting into another application.
