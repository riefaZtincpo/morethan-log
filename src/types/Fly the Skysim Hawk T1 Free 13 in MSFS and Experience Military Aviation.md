## Skysim Hawk T2: A Future Flight Simulator Add-on for MSFS
 
While Skysim Hawk T1 is a great add-on for FSX, many flight simulator enthusiasts are wondering if there will be a Skysim Hawk T2 for Microsoft Flight Simulator (MSFS), the latest and most advanced flight simulation platform. The Hawk T2 is an improved version of the Hawk T1, with a glass cockpit, digital avionics, and enhanced performance. It is used by the RAF and the Royal Navy for advanced fast jet training, as well as by other air forces such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
 
Unfortunately, there is no official confirmation or announcement from Skysim about a Hawk T2 add-on for MSFS. However, there are some hints and clues that suggest that Skysim might be working on it or planning to do so in the future. For example, on the official Skysim website[^4^], there is a section called "Coming Soon" that shows a teaser image of a Hawk T2 cockpit with the caption "Hawk T2 - MSFS". On the Microsoft Flight Simulator forums[^3^], some users have reported seeing a Skysim Hawk T2 flying online in MSFS multiplayer mode, indicating that Skysim might be testing or developing the add-on internally. Moreover, on the AVSIM forums, some users have expressed their interest and support for a Skysim Hawk T2 add-on for MSFS, hoping that Skysim will release it soon.
 
Therefore, while there is no official word from Skysim about a Hawk T2 add-on for MSFS, there is some evidence that it might be in the works or on the horizon. If Skysim does release a Hawk T2 add-on for MSFS, it will surely be a welcome addition to the flight simulator community, as it will offer a realistic and immersive experience of flying a modern jet trainer in a stunning and dynamic environment. Until then, we can only wait and hope that Skysim will surprise us with some good news soon.
