One way to get some tribecore kicks is to use a sample pack, such as Sample Tribecore 1 by Fendelxanza5. This pack contains 10 tribecore kicks in WAV format, each with a different character and style. You can use them as they are, or you can tweak them to suit your needs.
  
In this article, we will show you how to use Sample Tribecore 1 to make your own tribecore kicks, using some basic tools and techniques. You will need a DAW (digital audio workstation) such as Ableton Live, FL Studio, or Logic Pro, and a sampler plugin such as Simpler, Sampler, or Kontakt.
  
## Step 1: Load a Kick Sample
  
The first step is to load one of the kick samples from Sample Tribecore 1 into your sampler plugin. You can choose any sample you like, depending on the mood and vibe you want for your track. For this example, we will use the sample called "Sample Tribecore 1 - Kick 5.wav".

Drag and drop the sample into your sampler plugin, and make sure it is set to play in one-shot mode. This means that the sample will play in full every time you trigger it with a MIDI note, regardless of how long you hold the note. You can adjust the volume, pitch, and start/end points of the sample as you wish.
  
## Step 2: Add Some Distortion
  
One of the main characteristics of tribecore kicks is their distortion. Distortion adds harmonics and saturation to the sound, making it more aggressive and loud. There are many types of distortion effects you can use, such as overdrive, bitcrush, waveshape, or tube distortion.
  
For this example, we will use a simple overdrive effect on our kick sample. Overdrive simulates the sound of an analog amplifier being pushed beyond its limits, creating a warm and fuzzy distortion. You can use any overdrive plugin you have in your DAW, or you can use a free one such as CamelCrusher.
  
Add an overdrive plugin after your sampler plugin in your signal chain, and tweak the settings to your liking. You can adjust the amount of drive (distortion), tone (brightness), and mix (wet/dry balance) of the effect. Be careful not to overdo it, as too much distortion can make your kick sound muddy and noisy.
  
## Step 3: Add Some EQ
  
The next step is to add some EQ (equalization) to your kick sample. EQ allows you to boost or cut specific frequency ranges of the sound, shaping its tonal balance and clarity. You can use any EQ plugin you have in your DAW, or you can use a free one such as TDR Nova.
  
Add an EQ plugin after your overdrive plugin in your signal chain, and use it to fine-tune your kick sound. You can use different types of filters (such as low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, or notch) to remove unwanted frequencies or enhance desired ones. For example, you can cut some low frequencies below 40 Hz to remove rumble and sub-bass that might interfere with your bassline; you can boost some mid frequencies around 200 Hz to add some punch and body to your kick; and you can cut some high frequencies above 10 kHz to reduce hiss and harshness.
  
## Step 4: Add Some Compression
  
The final step is to add some compression to your kick sample. Compression is a dynamic effect that reduces the volume difference between the loudest and quietest parts of the sound, making it more consistent and powerful. You can use any compression plugin you have in your DAW, or you can use a free one such as Rough Rider.
  
Add a compression plugin after your EQ plugin in your signal chain, and use it to glue your kick sound
