## Some Interesting Facts About Buddhism
  
Besides watching Zee TV Buddha serial episodes online, you can also learn more about Buddhism by exploring some of the interesting facts about this religion and philosophy. Here are some of them:

- Buddha has been in dozens of movies. The life and teachings of Buddha have inspired many filmmakers to portray him on the big screen. Some of the famous movies that feature Buddha or his followers are Little Buddha (1993), Kundun (1997), Seven Years in Tibet (1997), The Matrix (1999), and Samsara (2001) [^1^].
- Buddhism has no holy book. Unlike many other religions, Buddhism does not have a single sacred scripture that contains all the teachings of Buddha. Instead, there are thousands of texts that have been written by various Buddhist schools and traditions over the centuries. Some of the most important texts are the Pali Canon, the Mahayana Sutras, and the Tibetan Book of the Dead [^2^].
- Siddhartha Gautama is not the only Buddha. According to Buddhist belief, there have been many Buddhas in the past and there will be many Buddhas in the future. A Buddha is someone who has attained complete enlightenment and has taught others how to achieve it. The most recent Buddha was Siddhartha Gautama, who lived in India around 2500 years ago. The next Buddha will be Maitreya, who is expected to appear in the world when it is ready for his teachings [^2^].
- The concept of trinity is also present in Buddhism. Although Buddhism does not believe in a creator god, it does have a concept of a triad or a trinity of three aspects of reality. These are called Dharma (the teachings of Buddha), Sangha (the community of Buddhists), and Buddha (the enlightened one). Together, they are known as the Three Jewels or the Three Refuges, which are the core of Buddhist faith and practice [^2^].

These are just some of the fascinating facts about Buddhism that you can discover by reading books, visiting websites, or watching documentaries. Of course, you can also enjoy watching Zee TV Buddha serial episodes online and learn more about the life and teachings of Buddha through this historical drama.
