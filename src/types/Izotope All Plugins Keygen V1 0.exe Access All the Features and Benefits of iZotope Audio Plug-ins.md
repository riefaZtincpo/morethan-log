### Symbol Library
 
SEE Electrical V7 has a large library of symbols and components that you can use in your diagrams. You can drag and drop them from the symbol explorer or use the quick insert function to place them on your drawing. You can also create your own symbols or import them from other sources. The symbols are organized by categories and subcategories, such as power supply, relays, switches, motors, sensors, PLCs and more. You can also customize the appearance and properties of the symbols, such as color, size, orientation, text and attributes.
 
### Cross-References
 
SEE Electrical V7 automatically generates cross-references for your symbols and wires. Cross-references show the location and page number of the related elements in your project. You can choose between different types of cross-references, such as horizontal, vertical, matrix or table. You can also customize the format and style of the cross-references, such as font, color, alignment and spacing. Cross-references help you navigate and check your diagrams easily and quickly.
 
### Terminal Strips
 
SEE Electrical V7 allows you to create terminal strips for your diagrams. Terminal strips are graphical representations of the connections between wires and terminals. You can create terminal strips automatically from your diagrams or manually from scratch. You can also edit and modify the terminal strips as you wish. You can add or remove terminals, change their order, assign wire numbers, colors and labels, add accessories and more. Terminal strips help you simplify and organize your wiring.
 
### Bills of Materials
 
SEE Electrical V7 automatically generates bills of materials (BOMs) for your projects. BOMs are lists of the components and materials used in your diagrams. You can generate BOMs by project, by folder or by drawing. You can also customize the content and layout of the BOMs, such as columns, headers, footers, filters and sorting. You can export BOMs to Excel or other formats for further processing or printing.
 
### Integration with Other Software
 
SEE Electrical V7 integrates with other software such as AutoCAD, EPLAN and SolidWorks. You can import or export drawings from these software to SEE Electrical V7 or vice versa. You can also link data between SEE Electrical V7 and these software to ensure consistency and accuracy. For example, you can link component attributes between SEE Electrical V7 and SolidWorks to avoid duplication and errors.
